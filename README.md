# ActionTracer

Log Rails application actions and filters when accepts a request.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'action_tracer', group: [:development, :test]
```

Notice this gem is for Rails with ApplicationController inherited ActiveController::Base.  
Support for Rails application with ActiveController::API is comming soon.

## Usage

Run rails server or run rspec and check `log/action_tracer.log`.

### Example

For example, you have a simple `awesome_controller.rb` like this:

```ruby
class AwesomeController < ApplicationController
  before_action :require_login
  before_action :set_awesome, only: :show
  around_action :with_readonly
  after_action :store_location
  
  def index
   # ...
  end

  def show
    # ...
  end

private

  def require_login
    # ...
  end

  def with_readonly
    # ...
    yield
    # ...
  end

  def store_location
    # ...
  end
end
```

When you run rails server and access `/awesome` (action is `#index`),  
it will put logs for `log/action_tracer.log` like this:

```log
I, [2020-09-27T03:25:43.018298 #1]  INFO -- : ["APPLIED", :set_turbolinks_location_header_from_session, "/usr/local/bundle/gems/turbolinks-5.2.1/lib/turbolinks/redirection.rb", 43]

```

Filters are put in the order in which is executed.  
Notice `around_action` is put 2 times around action though called 1 time.

### Log Guide

Normally log is put in this format:

```ruby
["APPLIED", :require_login, "app/controllers/awesome_controller.rb", 17]
```

1. State. One of `APPLIED`, `NO_APPLIED` and `ACTION`.  
`APPLIED`: Filter is executed.  
`NO_APPLIED`: Filter is registered but not executed.  
`ACTION`: Called action.
2. Method name. When filter is a Proc, just put `:Proc`.
3. File path. In your application directory, it's omitted path. See Configuration section for details.
4. Method line no.

When filter is an object, log is put in this format:

```ruby
["UNRECOGNIZED", #<Awesome::Object:0x00007f95c35768f8>]
```

We can't recognize the filter is actually executed or not.

### Configuration

To customize how to output log, add `config/initializers/action_tracer.rb`:

```ruby
ActionTracer.configure do |config|
  # when you want to omit source_location path
  config.omitted_source_location_paths = ["#{Dir.pwd}/"]
  # e.g.
  # config.omitted_source_location_paths = []
  #   ["APPLIED", :require_login, "/Users/makicamel/works/github.com/makicamel/myapp/app/controllers/awesome_controller.rb", 17]
  # config.omitted_source_location_paths = ["#{Dir.pwd}/"]
  #   ["APPLIED", :require_login, "app/controllers/awesome_controller.rb", 17]

  # when you want to output log to stdout
  config.logger = Rails.logger
end
```

- `omitted_source_location_paths`: Omitted source_location path. In default `["#{Dir.pwd}/"]`.
- `logger`: Injectable logger. For example, to specify to output log to stdout.
- `directory`: The directory to put log. In default `/log/`.
- `file_name`: The log file name. In default `action_tracer.log`.
